# Mentor Code Issues
The goal behind this repo is to have a place where we can record the tricky issues that students have faced.  If it's a large error, have the student push their code to a branch.  Fork their repo, and point provide a link to it in the file.

For self contained issues make a new file to show the issue and the solution.

Right now it's pretty bare boned.  But we all run into weird stuff fairly frequently.  If we document them here, hopefully we'll be able to cut down on how long they take to solve.
