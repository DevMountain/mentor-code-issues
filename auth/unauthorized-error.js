// When getting an unauthorized error while you are trying to log in using Auth0:

// 1. Verify that domain, clientID, clientSecret, and callbackURL are set up correctly in your auth strategy.
// 2. Log in to auth0.com and check the rules tab. By default, you should not have any rules. If you do, remove/disable all rules.
